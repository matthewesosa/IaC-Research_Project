## Terraform and Cloudformation: A Comparative Study of Infrastructure as Code Tools on AWS

#
Organizations often opt for cloud provisioning and configuration management tools as a means to streamline and automate the provisioning and configuration of their cloud resources. Two widely recognized tools for infrastructure automation are Terraform and CloudFormation, which excel at enabling the configuration, provisioning, and management of infrastructure as code.

According to the "Flexera State of the Cloud Report 2022," a substantial 50% of organizations have already embraced AWS CloudFormation in their infrastructure operations, with an additional 20% in the planning stages of its adoption. Similarly, Terraform has found favor with 30% of organizations, and an extra 20% are actively considering its implementation.

The goal of this research project is to study and evaluate the effectiveness of these two Infrastructure as Code tools for automating the provisioning of cloud infrastructures; and determine which is better suited using a specific case study of provisioning a 'High Availability WebApp Architecture' on AWS.
#
The research aims to answer the following questions:

• What are the neccessary software qualities that defines the effectiveness of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools in automating and managing cloud infrastructure ?

• What are the key features and functionalities of Terraform and AWS CloudFormation as Infrastructure as Code tools, and how do these features contribute to the ease of provisioning, managing, and scaling cloud resources on the AWS platform?

• How does AWS Cloudformation compare to Terraform?
  - Performanance: deployment time and scalability
  - Developer Experience: learnability, IDE support and community support
  - Maintainability
